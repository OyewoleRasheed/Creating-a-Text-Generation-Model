# Text Generation Model using Python (LSTM)

This project is a character-level text generation model implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. It is a replication of the tutorial published by AmanXAI, demonstrating how to preprocess text, build an LSTM-based neural network, and generate human-like sequences from a custom seed.

## Features

- Character-level language modeling
- LSTM architecture using Keras Sequential API
- Sliding window sequence generation
- Configurable training parameters (sequence length, epochs, temperature)
- Text generation with sampling control

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional for visualization)

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
````
